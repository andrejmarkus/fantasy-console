**Caiven** is a retro-inspired fantasy console: a virtual machine and development environment written in Rust. Real embedded Lua 5.4 for game code, plus a full in-engine editor (Caiven Studio) — no custom bytecode language, every stdlib function just works.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Grab whichever matches what you want to do — Studio and Machine release
independently, so check both:

- **[Caiven Studio](https://github.com/andrejmarkus/caiven/releases?q=studio-v)** — the editor, to _make_ a game (code, sprites, sound, map). Windows/macOS/Linux installers.
- **[Caiven Machine](https://github.com/andrejmarkus/caiven/releases?q=machine-v)** — the standalone player, to just _run_ a `.cav` cart someone shared with you. No editor.

Install like any normal app and launch **Caiven Studio**, or unpack **Caiven Machine** and run:

```bash
./caiven-machine my-game/    # project dir, hot-reloads with Ctrl+R
./caiven-machine game.cav    # distribution cartridge
```

> **First launch warning?** Release builds aren't notarized/signed yet — your
> OS will flag the app as untrusted the first time. macOS: right-click the
> app → **Open** → **Open** again (or `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine
> /Applications/Caiven\ Studio.app`). Windows: **More info** → **Run
> anyway**. See [code signing status](docs/releasing.md#code-signing-status)
> for details.

Building from source, the Cargo workspace, and Studio/Machine CLI reference
are in [docs/building.md](docs/building.md).

## 🐣 A taste of Caiven Lua

```lua
function _init()
  set_palette_color(0, 10, 10, 30)  -- dark blue background
end

function _update()
  clear_screen()
  if button_down(3) then x = (x or 60) + 2 end  -- right
  sprite(0, x or 60, 60)
end
```

`_init()` runs once, `_update()` runs every frame, optional `_draw()` runs right after it. Full walkthrough: [docs/tutorial.md](docs/tutorial.md). Full builtin list: [docs/api-reference.md](docs/api-reference.md).
